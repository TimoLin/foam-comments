foam-comments
=============
This is a vim plugin based on [comments.vim](https://github.com/TimoLin/foam-comments)

## Description
The original comments.vim plugin has been adapted to comment/un-comment lines for files of OpenFOAM cases.  
For now, `*Dict`, `*Properties`, fvScheme`, `fvSolution`, `fvOptions` and other files under folder like `0`, `constant`, `system`, `polyMesh` are supported to do comment/un-comment through key-mappings: `<Ctrl-C>`/`Ctrl-V` respectively.
